# RPALCompiler
Compiler for the RPAL language, Semester 4 PL project

Abstract: 
The project involves creating an interpreter for the RPAL (Right-reference Pedagogic 
Algorithmic Language) programming language. This interpreter will include several key 
components: a lexical analyzer, a parser, generation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), 
conversion to a Standardized Tree (ST), and a Control Stack Environment (CSE) 
machine to execute RPAL programs. The main goal of the project is to build a working 
RPAL interpreter that can parse and run RPAL code, offering a deeper understanding of 
the language's structure and semantics.
